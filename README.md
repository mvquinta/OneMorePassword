## General Information
This was my first project with which I learnt how to code and managed to publish my own app in under four months.
I wanted to prove myself two things: if I could code and if I liked to code. I could and I liked it!

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin
- Android Studio

## Features
- Pomodoro Clock Timer - Three different sessions (Pomodoro, Short Break, Long Break) that allow edition.
- Todo List - Add Task, Edit Task, Add Project and Switch Project.
- Responsive.

## Contributions
If you would like to contribute that would be awesome!
Just clone the project and install dependencies

`git clone git@github.com:mvquinta/1-pomodoro.git`
`npm install`


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

Issues:
- Sometimes edit task does not work. It's a bug that I'm not being able to reproduce constantly. I believe it haves something to do on how I'm dealing with state.

To do:
- Animate exterior circle. It should have an progress animation that will fill the path circle from 0 to 100% as session time goes by.

Room for improvement:
- Account creation and Log In feature to save state of Pomodoro and Todolist. (At this moment I'm using localStorage)
